Sure, here is a Flutter function that takes the contents of an HTML file as a string, finds standard HTML includes, and replaces them with the contents of the corresponding files from a "snippets" folder.

To achieve this, you'll need to use Dart's `RegExp` to find the includes and the `dart:io` library to read the contents of the snippet files.

Here's the implementation:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:async';

Future<String> replaceIncludes(String htmlContent) async {
  // Define a regular expression to find includes like <!--#include file="filename.html"-->
  final includeRegex = RegExp(r'<!--#include file="(.+?)"-->');

  // Find all matches in the HTML content
  final matches = includeRegex.allMatches(htmlContent);

  // Iterate over all matches
  for (final match in matches) {
    // Extract the filename from the match
    final filename = match.group(1);

    if (filename != null) {
      // Construct the path to the snippet file
      final snippetPath = 'snippets/$filename';

      // Read the contents of the snippet file
      try {
        final snippetContent = await File(snippetPath).readAsString();

        // Replace the include directive with the contents of the snippet file
        htmlContent = htmlContent.replaceFirst(match.group(0)!, snippetContent);
      } catch (e) {
        print('Error reading file $snippetPath: $e');
        // Handle the error as needed
      }
    }
  }

  return htmlContent;
}

void main() async {
  // Example usage
  final htmlFileContent = '''
  <html>
    <head>
      <!--#include file="header.html"-->
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <!--#include file="footer.html"-->
    </body>
  </html>
  ''';

  final updatedHtmlContent = await replaceIncludes(htmlFileContent);

  print(updatedHtmlContent);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Regular Expression**: The `includeRegex` is a regular expression that matches the `<!--#include file="filename.html"-->` pattern.
2. **Finding Matches**: `allMatches` method is used to find all occurrences of the include directives in the HTML content.
3. **Iterating over Matches**: For each match, the filename is extracted and the corresponding snippet file is read.
4. **Replacing Includes**: The `replaceFirst` method replaces the include directive with the contents of the snippet file.
5. **Error Handling**: If there is an error reading a file, it is caught and logged, allowing the function to continue processing other includes.

### Notes:

- Ensure the `snippets` folder is in the correct location relative to your project directory.
- This function assumes the snippets are small and can be read synchronously. For large files or a large number of includes, consider optimizing the reading and processing.

You can use this function to process HTML files and replace includes as needed.
